    "comment": "Most of the Tenets are rather fuzzy, unless we're trying to stick to some character limit need to explain more detail what they actually mean otherwise most of them come across as 'be good, don't do bad stuff, use common sense'. Did not understand the paragraph on budget durations/limits. Did not understand point about 'Info' actions prevented from being recorded on chain. Could use some section on the subject of transparency when it comes to distribution and utilization of treasury funds, i.e. what is expected from the people/entities requesting treasury withdrawals. Would be nice to have a tenet about striving to maintain high levels of stake decentralization, to help combat any future proposals that might directly or indirectly contribute to large stake consolidation in the hands of the few. All 'shall publicly disclose' points seem to lack detail on how/where to disclose and is there any enforcement planned. Why 65% threshold for amendments picked when we're starting with 75% DRep threshold for such at protocol level? Why the need for 3 months wait in case of change to critical protocol parameter? If we have must not be lower than X in guardrail script, why do we also have seemingly redundant must not be zero and must not be negative? Treasury cut section has two contradicting statements - if you want to mention valid ranges for parameters from implementation perspective, do so clearly and consistently please. Explain the rationale behind 250 and 2000 stakePoolTargetNum lower and upper limits please. Why just govDeposit should be adjusted in line with fiat changes, what about several other Ada/lovelace based parameters? Why do we want to limit the number of active DReps? Should net change limit for treasury be decided on prior to constitution ratification, so it could be included in it? stakePoolDeposit purpose - I thought it was at least in part to prevent Joe Blogs from registering 2000 pools tomorrow and flooding the wallet pool lists. More detail needed about how we're planning on estimating the cost of operating a pool, so we can tell if some of these seemingly magic numbers make sense - e.g. why 500 Ada max min pool cost. stakePoolTargetNum section needs revamp - any sign of network approaching equilibrium state... since when does stake pool division/replication ensure decentralization, purpose of the parameter was to spread the stake across more pools... not sure about the significance of the frightening mass redelegation events reference. poolPledgeInfluence limits are also a bit of a joke given the setting has been proven to be ineffective years ago and IOHK themselves had a team working on how to improve it/redesign it without seemingly any fruitful results. All in all, a bit more detail in some areas, a bit less redundant text in other areas would be appreciated - and thanks to those working on fine-tuning it."
