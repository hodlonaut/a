In this milestone we created a Staking Basket on Cardano's preview network. We deposited two thousand ADA and delegated it to ten different stakepools.

I recorded the process of creating the Basket, depositing ADA, and the multi-delegation. The first video is the creation of the Basket, and the second video has commentary that tells you exactly what's going on.

Here is the link to both videos:

Milestone submitted at	October 10, 2023 at 1:06 AM	
Milestone Title	Staking Basket Testing - 50 SPOs one Basket	
Milestone Outputs	
We'll gather 50 real stakepool operators on Cardano's preview network to be Basket operators. We'll create a smart-contract that delegates millions of ADA to these 50 SPOs to test the smart-contract. Users and SPOs will be able to submit these issues into a google form. This will output the any issues users or SPOs with the smart-contract, and the front-end interface. We'll now be able to solve these issues before we release Staking Baskets to mainnet.

We'll submit on-chain evidence of the smart-contract that delegates millions of ADA to 50 SPOs. We'll send this on-chain evidence by sharing a Cardano preview blockchain explorer, with a link to the original smart-contract creation, a user withdraw, and a user deposit. We'll also submit a video of the Basket data on our simple front-end interface we created in the last milestone. We'll also submit the user feedback forms from SPOs, and users.

For this milestone we created a Staking Basket on Cardano's preview network, and then slowly added in more pools until we were at a total of 50 different stakepools at a time.

Here are the transactions for creating the Staking Basket smart-contract on-chain:

*Resubmission updates:

We had one of of two reviewers deny our proof of achievement claiming that there was no way to verify that the pools on the front-end matched up with the actual Basket. Although the reviewer could have found that there is millions of ADA delegated to 50 SPOs through the transactions provided, we will provide another link that shows a detailed overview of the multi-delegation.

This link is the script address on cexplorer, it shows the multi-delegation, the ADA and all of the pools.

Acceptance criteria	
This milestone should be accepted, given that there are 50 deposits from different staking keys to test Staking Basket smart-contracts on Cardano's preview network. We will analyze that the 50 deposits were successful by checking on-chain data, and having a user feedback form available for failed deposits.

For this milestone we've opened up our platform to a few hundred people to try Staking Baskets for the first time. We've compiled all of the user addresses that made Staking Basket deposits into a spreadsheet. You can view the deposits by querying any of these addresses in an explorer application. If you see a transaction that's interacting with a smart-contract, and it gives the user 'Diffusion' tokens for ADA deposits. That's a Staking Basket transaction.

This is a link to the Diffusion token that you get for depositing into the Basket on Cardanoscan: 

https://preview.cardanoscan.io/token/asset13h5p3alpgrjynrevvkkgq4uys3f4e2dv8x74ng

You can see that there's been over 1400 transactions with the token. If you scroll down you can see a large amount of Staking Basket deposits/withdraws from various users.

We opted to not use user-feedback forms and created a channel for early Staking Basket testers to provide their feedback, and list any bugs they ran into. This allowed us to work directly with each individual instead of trying to contact them after form submission. I compiled a list of various reviews here:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQHHA64zo9dR6ZYP169y4FhRf1PWtDlx?usp=sharing

This is a compiled list of user feedback in our Discord. If any reviewer wants to verify these by joining our Discord, please tag me and I will assign the correct role. We had ALOT more feedback than just 50.

You can also verify the creation of the Staking Basket on chain through these transactions:

Milestone submitted at	October 10, 2023 at 1:24 AM	
Milestone Title	Staking Basket Stylized Front-End Interface & Integration - Larger Testing Group	
Milestone Outputs	
This milestone will mark the completion of our Catalyst proposal. The outputs for this milestone will be a stylized front-end that's connected to the smart-contract on Cardano's preview network. Users can use this front-end to deposit ADA, get Basket tokens, and withdraw their staking rewards + their ADA with their Basket tokens. We also may find more bugs, and ways to improve our UX/smart-contract. With this final milestone, we're gathering 150 real Cardano users with different staking addresses to test Baskets, and provide feedback.

approvals

Acceptance criteria	
This milestone should be accepted given that there's a stylized front-end interface where users can deposit ADA for Basket tokens, and withdraw their ADA/staking rewards using their Basket tokens. There will also need to be 150 real users that deposit into Baskets, and fill out a feedback form.

Evidence of milestone completion	
We'll submit a video depositing/withdrawing into the Basket that contains 50 SPOs using our stylized front-end. We'll also submit on-chain evidence of this smart-contract, the deposit, and 150 feedback forms from real Cardano users.

We'll also submit a final written report that details the results of this proposal.

You will need to use a wallet that supports Cardano's preview network. We recommend using Eternl.

Some of this user feedback is quick so that they can fill out the form, however if you keep scrolling there is valuable feedback. During this testnet we also have a discord server at https://discord.gg/atriumlab. In this Discord there was thousands of messages of feedback that allowed us to increase the user experience, and fix bugs.
